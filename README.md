#### Introduction

Welcome to the 'Supply Chain Logistics Optimization' project, where we embarked on an exciting journey of data analysis and exploration within the realm of supply chain logistics. As a data scientist, I had the privilege of leading a talented team in this transformative project, dedicated to enhancing supply chain logistics through data-driven strategies, particularly by leveraging the power of SQL.

#### Objective

Our mission was to unravel the complexities of the 'Supply Chain Logistics' dataset, which consisted of seven tables, including 'OrderList,' 'FreightRates,' 'WhCosts,' 'WhCapacities,' 'ProductsPerPlant,' 'VmiCustomers,' and 'PlantPorts.' By skillfully using SQL Query writing, we aimed to uncover valuable insights, trends, and opportunities for supply chain optimization.

#### My Role

My contributions to this project included:

- Analyzing data with SQL to extract valuable insights.
- Collaborating with a talented team to explore the complexities of the dataset.
- Translating data-driven findings into actionable recommendations.

#### Conclusion

Presenting our findings to stakeholders showcased the tremendous potential of data querying with SQL in driving business growth and competitiveness. This project exemplified the power of teamwork and data-driven decision-making, highlighting the critical role of data analyis in shaping the future of supply chain logistics.

Thank you for exploring our journey in optimizing supply chain logistics through the combined power of SQL and data.
